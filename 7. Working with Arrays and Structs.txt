– Example arrays 
WITH
 Sequences AS (
   SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers UNION ALL
   SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] UNION ALL
   SELECT [5, 10]
 )
SELECT * FROM Sequences




– Length of arrays
WITH Sequences AS
 (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT some_numbers,
      ARRAY_LENGTH(some_numbers) AS len
FROM Sequences;


– Map from array to set of rows
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'cor', 'gar', 'wal', 'fod'])
 AS element
WITH OFFSET AS offset
ORDER BY offset;
