Write a query to return the station ID and name of stations that have more than 70 bikes available.
SELECT
 station_id,
 name
FROM
 `<<your project id>>.nyc_citi_bike_trips.citibike_stations`
WHERE
 num_bikes_available > 70
LIMIT
 1000




Modify the above query to join the stations table to the trips table.  Add trip duration and bike ID columns to the query.
SELECT
 station_id,
 name,
 bikeid
 tripduration
FROM
 `<<your project id>>.nyc_citi_bike_trips.citibike_stations` s
JOIN
 `<<your project id>>.nyc_citi_bike_trips.citibike_trips` t
ON
 s.station_id = CAST(start_station_id as STRING)
WHERE
 num_bikes_available > 70
LIMIT
 1000




Finally, modify the query to return the minimum and maximum trip durations.


SELECT
 min(tripduration) min_duration,
 max(tripduration) max_duration
FROM
 `<<your project id>>.nyc_citi_bike_trips.citibike_stations` s
JOIN
 `<<your project id>>.nyc_citi_bike_trips.citibike_trips` t
ON
 s.station_id = CAST(start_station_id as STRING)
WHERE
 num_bikes_available > 70
LIMIT
 1000
